# Requirement Analysis in Software Development:

focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
It’s the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting what the customer needs from the software system. it consists of 4 steps:
1- Requirement Gathering

Talking to stakeholders (clients, users, business analysts),Collecting information through interviews, questionnaires, workshops, observations.

2-Requirement Categorization

Functional Requirements → What the system should do (features, operations), Non-functional Requirements → How the system should behave (performance, security, scalability).

3-Requirement Analysis & Validation

Checking for completeness, consistency, and feasibility, Resolving conflicts between stakeholders.

4-Documentation

Writing down requirements in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document, This serves as a contract between clients and the development team.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1.Prevents misunderstandings between client & developers.

2.Reduces costly changes later in development.

3.Provides a clear roadmap for design & coding.

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
1. Requirement Gathering 📋

What it is: Collecting all possible needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, end-users, managers, etc.).

How it’s done:

Interviews

Questionnaires

Observations

Brainstorming sessions

Reviewing existing systems

Goal: Get a raw list of what users want.

Example: For an online food delivery app, stakeholders might say:

"I want to order food online."

"Restaurants should update their menus easily."

"Payment should be secure."

2. Requirement Elicitation 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

What it is: Digging deeper into requirements to clarify, refine, and prioritize them.

How it’s done:

Workshops

Prototyping

Use cases & user stories

Focus groups

Goal: Move from “what people say they want” → to clear, detailed requirements.

Example:

Instead of just “secure payment,” elicitation discovers:

"We need multiple payment methods (credit card, PayPal, wallet)."

"Transactions must be encrypted with SSL."

3. Requirement Documentation 📝

What it is: Writing requirements in a structured format so everyone (developers, testers, clients) understands.

Common output: SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document.

What’s included:

Functional requirements (features).

Non-functional requirements (performance, usability, security).

Constraints (time, budget, technology).

Example:
The SRS for the food app might state:

FR1: The system shall allow users to track their order in real-time.

NFR1: The system shall handle up to 10,000 orders per minute.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 🧩

What it is: Examining requirements for feasibility, conflicts, and completeness, then modeling them visually.

Tools used:

UML diagrams (Use case, Class, Sequence, Activity).

Data flow diagrams (DFD).

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD).

Goal: Turn requirements into a blueprint for system design.

Example:

A Use Case Diagram showing "User → Place Order → Restaurant receives order → Delivery assigned."

5. Requirement Validation ✅

What it is: Checking that requirements are correct, clear, consistent, and meet user needs.

How it’s done:

Requirement reviews (stakeholders + team).

Prototypes / mockups for confirmation.

Test cases prepared based on requirements.

Goal: Ensure “we are building the right product.”

Example:

Stakeholders test a prototype of the ordering screen and confirm it matches what they expect.

Ambiguous requirement like “system should be fast” is clarified to: “Response time ≤ 2 seconds.”
